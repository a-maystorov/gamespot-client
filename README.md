## What is GameSpot

GameSpot is a service that allows easy management for games along with customers and rentals. It lets users add games and customer information to the database for future rental opportunities and eventually processing the return while setting the date out, date returned, and the rental fee.

### Motivation:

My biggest motivation behind every project that I have build is my love for coding and solving problems; but this one is special. I have played and loved everything about video games from a very young age, which sparked my love for coding in the first place. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like every gamer out there at some point in their life dreamed about owning a video game store, and that's where this idea was born. I asked myself how can I most efficiently run a video game store or rental service if I were to do it now, and the answer resulted in this project.
